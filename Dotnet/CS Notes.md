`public static string Remark => string.Empty;` and `public string Remark { get; set; } = string.Empty;` are two different ways of defining and accessing a property in C#. The difference lies in the use of the `static` keyword.

1. `public static string Remark => string.Empty;`:
   This is a static property. The `static` keyword indicates that the property belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class. It can be accessed using the class name directly, without creating an instance of the class. In this case, the property `Remark` is read-only (`get` only), and it always returns an empty string (`string.Empty`). Since it is static, there is a single instance of the property shared across all instances of the class.

2. `public string Remark { get; set; } = string.Empty;`:
   This is an instance property. It does not use the `static` keyword, which means it belongs to individual instances of the class. Each instance of the class will have its own separate copy of the `Remark` property. The `get` and `set` keywords allow reading and writing of the property's value, respectively. In this case, the property is read-write, and it is initially set to an empty string (`string.Empty`).

In summary, the main difference is that a static property is associated with the class itself and can be accessed without creating an instance, whereas an instance property belongs to each individual instance of the class. The choice between static and instance properties depends on the desired behaviour and how the property should be accessed and shared within your program.

```c#
namespace HelloWorld{
class Hello {
static void Main
}
}
```

```cs
public string Name {get;set;} = string.Empty;
```

```bash
docker logs
```

```ps
docker logs
```
